These are the scripts for CutLang run on condor batch jobs and make plots

-- pre-requisition
  --> CMSSW_12_6_5
  --> voms proxy in current working directory as the name [ proxy.cert ]


1. Running

-- RunCutLangBatchJob_v<version-number>.py : Runs the list of samples given in [samplelist] directory on condor.
  --> Before run this script, please make proxy using following comand:
        $ voms-proxy-init -voms cms -out proxy.cert -valid 48:00
  --> If you want you can change the proxy life time to change valid option.
      But, You must not change the [ -out proxy.cert ] option.
  --> When you run this script, the [ WorkDir_job_<jobID> ] will be created.
      In this directory, you can find condor_sub script and execution script for condor.
      And also log directory.   

-- samplelist : You need to put samples list as txt file
In this directory, there is [ SampleListMaker.py ]. This is the script for make sample list using das query with data-set address


2. Plotting

-- [ plotting_code ] directory
  --> In this directory you can find plotting script [ Plotting_v1.py ].
      And configuration file [ Config_forPlotting_v1.txt ] for plotting.
  --> [ QCDmerger_With_Weight.py ] will help you to merge QCD histogram with calculated weight.



Better commented versions of the below scripts are in jupyter notebook format here:
https://github.com/unelg/CutLang/tree/master/binder

-- compareplots.py : Compare signal with a background. The plots are weighted.
One can also adjust weights to 1 to do shape comparison.
Better commented version:

In github, there is also a simple shape comparison script, from the previous year's exercise
https://github.com/unelg/CutLang/blob/master/binder/ROOTshapecomparison.ipynb

-- fullplots.py : Makes weighted plots for signal(s), BG and data.
